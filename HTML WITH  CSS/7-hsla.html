<h1>Marine Biology</h1>
<h2>The Composition Of SeaWater</h2>
<p> Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials from 
Earth's crust as well as materials released from organisms. The most important
components of seawater that influence life are salinity, temperature, dissolved gases 
(mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and pH. These elements vary in their 
composition as well as in their influence on marine life </p>
